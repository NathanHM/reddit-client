# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Reddit Client

An app designed to pull in posts from all the subreddits I frequent, allowing me to see all the information in one place, with a consistent style desiugned by me. Created as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer path.

See deployed version here: https://ssl-reddit-client.netlify.app/dashboard

## Limitations

Project is still in development, and the URI currently redirects to local host instead of the provided URL, so sign-in is not currently functioning.

Project is designed for personal use, and thus has no method for selecting which subreddits to display.

Votes are managed in state, and would require backend and user accounts to persist. Could also collect upvotes for user account from Reddit, but API only provides the 100 most recent upvotes.
